# Dumper: A Tool To Dump Android ROM/Firmware.

---

---

## Introduction:

Dumper is a powerful extraction tool designed to extract partitions and information from Android firmware packages. It simplifies the process of extracting, analyzing, and organizing firmware components for developers, ROM builders, and Android enthusiasts.

### Features:

- Extract system, vendor, product, and other partitions from various firmware formats
- Support for multiple firmware packaging formats (zip, tar, ozip, ofp, ops, kdz, etc.)
- Intelligent detection of firmware type and automatic extraction
- Extract boot, recovery, dtbo images and analyze kernel information
- Generate proprietary-files lists with SHA1 checksums
- Generate TWRP and AOSP device trees
- Upload extracted firmware to GitHub/GitLab repositories
- Send notifications via Telegram

### Directory Structure:

- `input/`: Place your firmware files here
- `utils/`: Contains supportive tools and programs
- `out/`: Output directory for extracted files
  - `out/tmp/`: Temporary working directory

### Supported File Formats:

- Archives: `.zip`, `.rar`, `.7z`, `.tar`, `.tar.gz`, `.tgz`, `.tar.md5`
- Vendor formats: `.ozip`, `.ofp`, `.ops`, `.kdz`, `ruu_*exe`
- System images: `system.new.dat`, `system.new.dat.br`, `system.new.dat.xz`, `system.new.img`, `system.img`, `system-sign.img`, `UPDATE.APP`
- Other formats: `*.emmc.img`, `*.img.ext4`, `system.bin`, `system-p`, `payload.bin`, `*.nb0`, `.*chunk*`, `*.pac`, `*super*.img`, `*system*.sin`
